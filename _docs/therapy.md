# Recovery

Before I start writing, there is a million ways to do everything.
Be open, do not close doors, and you are always able to be yourself.
This is just one discussion on the topic their are many on it. please be open minded.

>I am doingg...I am umm doing ..okay I think I am here because I am ready to start my recovery.

## Therapy Questions

I am in therapy. 
- what does that mean?
- what do I do in here?
- am I crazy for being here?
- am I weak?

How do I break the news to you(people I love)?

## Therapy Notes

As a top note. Just as not all medications do not work for all mental illnesses, such goes for all types of therapies you might have to try different types of therapies to fit your needs. **Do not** let this be a barrier for better health **please**. Just so you know it is not you not fitting in the therapy but the therapy might not be fitting you.

There might be many specialized therapies out there, sometimes these are a fit _sometimes_. Other times we need a psychologoist or a therapist who is expertise to help with how we connect or do not connect with people. Therapy is _more than our diagnosis just like we are_. 

### My First Round of Lying 

>I was diagnosed at an early age with bipolar, I was sent to therapy in 2005 but not ready to accept it... I discussed a light hearted story of my life, a light hearted approach to my problems, the things that made my problems sound like i could get by. I talked about doubts...but nothing under anything that felt of discomfort. This was where I made my mistakes the first time. I regret it now.

I spent probably 3 to 4 years going off and on in therapy but I always felt kinda positive coming out but never touched on the real reason, I needed to go. I talked about medications, I talked about life... but not the underlying problems just swept them under the rug, and I doubted life but felt it would somehow fix if itself if I was coming out positive.

### My 2017 Meltdown..Rise?

I found myself in a circle once again. Sleepless night. Nightares, not knowing who I was as a person. I could not explain myself to myself...let alone to anyone. I felt I was a failure.. I felt I was an inferior being and something was wrong with me. Until I saw on television all these stars coming forward with their past pains. Of abuse, and how shame could only be helped by seeking treatment. Not burying it deep within and holding it in, letting it turn you into the monster that came before you, or putting up fronts.Especially since, eventually anything We built, it sat there on the window seal of our accomplishments in the future. Waiting in the dark parts of our minds, still...not going away...not being relieved..haunting...day and night. Until we start to Shed these past pains. So I then again _sought therapy_.

## Finding A Therapist without insurance

I looked up services in my area. I contacted the recommended center, and I made appointments. _Finally_ my day arrived, I went in and filled out there sheets of paper (more like a novel). I met the therapist I was assigned. Then this kicked off the beginning of the journey to find the one to the right one. This was a difficult time. I research everything, I analyze all I can, and I recommend you do the same in this situation. Most Public health care sites do have a page about the bio's of the workers. So you can get some background on them, whether thats a bio, or just their professional credentials and title. Also, if not here within there website they should be able to help explain what their office specializes if not by Dr..

### Experience In this Office

If this is your option, sometimes they make you go through group therapy first. Not all, But the one near me **use** to have you do four group therapy sessions before getting access to a personal therapist. I am not saying others do this. Nor the one by me does this anymore but some offices that take medicaid might still do this.
