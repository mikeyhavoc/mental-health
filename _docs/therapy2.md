## Therapy Notes

As a top note. Just as not all medications do not work for all mental illnesses, such goes for all types of therapies you might have to try different types of therapies to fit your needs. **Do not** let this be a barrier for better health **please**. Just so you know it is not you not fitting in the therapy but the therapy might not be fitting you. But _please do not give up!_

# Dear Therapy Return

Part 2, of Dear therapy. As you recall in Dear Therapy part 1, I was discussing setting up that first appointment. It was more about setting up the appointment and some of the things you could possibly expect. From what I went through here in, FL.
Next I would like discuss the first session in therapy. 
once you get inside with a therapist. 

## Therapy Questions

I am in therapy. 
- what does that mean?
- what do I do in here?
- am I crazy for being here?
- am I weak?

How do I break the news to you(people I love)?
