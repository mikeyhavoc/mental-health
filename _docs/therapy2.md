### Is It Possible To Please

One, once you start calling sometimes when you start talking to them and they ask what your illness is. They will have specialist for that illness. If it is a man or woman and your not comfortable with a man or woman. **Note** This is a time to ask if they can acommodate you. This is going to be your therapy going on bi-ananuly. You need someone that you can discuss difficult things with. So trying to do things that will make you comfortable in an already diffifcult situation will help aleviate some of that.
