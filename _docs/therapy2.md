## Therapy Notes

As a top note. Just as not all medications do not work for all mental illnesses, such goes for all types of therapies you might have to try different types of therapies to fit your needs. **Do not** let this be a barrier for better health **please**. Just so you know it is not you not fitting in the therapy but the therapy might not be fitting you. But _please do not give up!_

# Dear Therapy Part 2

Part 2, of Dear therapy. As you recall in Dear Therapy part 1, I was discussing setting up that first appointment. It was more about setting up the appointment and some of the things you could possibly expect. From what I went through here in, FL.
Next I would like discuss the first session in therapy. 
once you get inside with a therapist. This is mostly parts of what I recall about _my first therapy session_. parts of what _I felt_ and things I brought up. Too what I wish I did, and parts of this article will be about thoughts and contemplation to be in your _first therapy_ session. 

## It Begins

So there I was in therapy, I tossed and turned all night, I felt sick to my stomach that morning, and I was nervous as all hell. Yet I was there.. I came even though I was anxious.. fretting.. plus going into the unknown. My psychologist asked. How was I... Yes indeed.. How was I? I had a million answers in my head. From nervous wreck, I do not know I can do this, I feel sick, ... I analze everything.. so there was a million answers. By the time I came back with an answer it was 'I am umm okay I think'. I asked myself `Really? thats the best you could come up with? your okay you think?!?! You are here to solve a million problems. You do not know where to start. The feeling of breaking down is on the horizon and you come back Mike with okay I think? UGH.` Never the less. I answered the question. So hey, kudos to me for being able to talk. soo, what might have I done next? I went into what I wanted. I brought the courage up a notch somehow. I said why I was there. I said I wanted to start my recovery. 

### What Entails

This is where my story fades... for now. As I embark on my recovery. I encourage others to do the same. To find that right therapist, to start your recovery. Their is some uncomfrotable feelings letting go of the pain. Yet once you do, it feels like it cannot harm you anymore. You get to see why you repeat the cycles of self defeat. These moments that help us in our struggle. The catch, is letting your guard down, Opening up, sometimes explaining things that are difficult, some are uncomfortable at first, and then really seeing them for what they are.
