Some people go there in naps, others in day dreams, this is not that type. This was an exploration of another kind.A shot for something greater than anyone being. Looking at the candidates it was a crap shoot. But things have been won against highly statistical odds before. A journey of high stakes, lost loves, dishonesty, pain, and finding silver linings. Nothing good comes with out pain and nothing comes without a cost.

But nothing complete. there job was not to be complete.
