# Recovery

Before I start writing, there is a million ways to do everything.
Be open, do not close doors, and you are always able to be yourself.
This is just one discussion on the topic their are many on it. please be open minded.

>I am doingg...I am umm doing ..okay I think I am here because I am ready to start my recovery.

## Therapy

I am in therapy. 
- what does that mean?
- what do I do in here?
- am I crazy for being here?
- am I weak?

How do I break the news to you(people I love)?

## Thearapy In Depth

As a top note. Just as not all medications do not work for all mental illnesses, such goes for all types of therapies you might have to try different types of therapies to fit your needs. **Do not** let this be a barrier for better health **please**. Just so you know it is not you not fitting in the therapy but the therapy might not be fitting you.

There are many types of therapy out there, and special kinds for many different needs. So finding the right one for our special circumstances will heighten our probability of gaining success in reaching our full potential in recovery and most out of our therapy sessions.

### My First Round

>I was diagnosed at an early age with bipolar, I was sent to therapy in 2005 but not ready to accept it... I discussed a light hearted story of my life, a light hearted approach to my problems, the things that made my problems sound like i could get by. I talked about doubts...but nothing under anything that felt of discomfort. This was where I made my mistakes the first time. I regret it now.

I spent probably 3 to 4 years going off and on in therapy but I always felt kinda positive coming out but never touched on the real reason, I needed to go. I talked about medications, I talked about life... but not the underlying problems just swept them under the rug, and I doubted life but felt it would somehow fix if itself if I was coming out positive.
